##TODO: ##
using ansible for deploying the code and creating the instance on aws
run this script on a regular basis and store the data in ec2
via a rudimentary web front end let a user build and download a combined gif
polish for the software would be user-selectable timeframes and lakes/dtypes - DONT do this just get it working first
super big bonus: microservices architecture that includes a CI process to create and switchover instances on a code push (or some other trigger haven't decided yet)
